# Requirements Document

## Feature: Commit Hook System

**Description**: Ensure code passes formatting and linting

## Existing Codebase Analysis

### Current Quality Infrastructure

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Comprehensive system via `/scripts/install-hooks`
- **Formatters**: StyLua (configured), shfmt for shell scripts
- **Linters**: Luacheck with project-specific configuration
- **Build system**: Makefile with `lint`, `format`, `format-check`, `check` targets
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with quality validation jobs
- **Testing**: Busted framework with automated test runner

### Reusable Components

- File categorization and staged file detection logic
- Colored output system for user feedback
- Tool availability checking and installation guidance
- Error handling patterns with actionable messages
- Configuration management (stylua.toml, .luacheckrc)

## User Stories

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Hook Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing commit hooks to be more performant and reliable, so that I can commit code efficiently without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staged files are large THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently using parallel execution
2. WHEN binary files are staged THEN the system SHALL skip them automatically
3. WHEN tools are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions
4. WHEN hook execution fails unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL preserve Git state and provide recovery options
5. WHEN multiple file types are staged THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently where possible

### Requirement 2: Expanded File Type Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the commit hooks to support additional file types beyond Lua and shell scripts, so that I can maintain quality standards across all project files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Markdown files are staged THEN the system SHALL validate formatting and links
2. WHEN YAML/JSON files are staged THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and formatting
3. WHEN documentation files are staged THEN the system SHALL check for broken references
4. IF new file types are added THEN the system SHALL support easy extension via configuration
5. WHEN unsupported file types are staged THEN the system SHALL log them for potential future support

### Requirement 3: Advanced Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize hook behavior for different scenarios, so that I can adapt the quality checks to specific project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL allow relaxed checking with warnings
2. WHEN in CI mode THEN the system SHALL enforce strict checking with failures
3. WHEN custom rules are needed THEN the system SHALL support configuration overrides per directory
4. IF team standards change THEN the system SHALL support easy configuration updates
5. WHEN debugging hooks THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options

### Requirement 4: Integration with Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the commit hooks to integrate seamlessly with my development tools, so that I can fix issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting issues are detected THEN the system SHALL offer to auto-fix them
2. WHEN linting issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide editor-compatible error output
3. WHEN using partial commits THEN the system SHALL only check staged changes
4. IF hooks are bypassed THEN the system SHALL log the bypass for team visibility
5. WHEN working with large codebases THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators

## Edge Cases and Technical Constraints

### Edge Cases

- Large files or repositories (performance considerations)
- Binary files and generated content (auto-skip logic needed)
- Vendor directories and external dependencies (exclusion rules)
- Merge conflicts and interactive rebases (state preservation)
- Network-dependent checks (link validation, dependency updates)
- Cross-platform differences (Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility)

### Technical Constraints

- Must leverage existing `/scripts/install-hooks` infrastructure
- Should extend current Makefile targets and CI/CD workflow
- Must maintain compatibility with existing stylua.toml and .luacheckrc
- Should preserve current colored output and UX patterns
- Must work within existing file categorization system

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Hook execution should remain under current 5-10 second typical runtime
- Should utilize existing parallel processing capabilities in install-hooks
- Must cache tool availability checks to avoid repeated validations

### Compatibility

- Must maintain compatibility with existing StyLua and Luacheck configurations
- Should extend current shfmt shell script formatting
- Must work with existing Busted test framework integration
- Should align with current GitHub Actions workflow structure

### Reliability

- Must preserve existing graceful degradation when tools are missing
- Should maintain current Git state protection mechanisms
- Must extend existing error message patterns for consistency
- Should leverage current tool installation guidance system
