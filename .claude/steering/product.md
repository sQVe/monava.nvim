# Product Vision - monava.nvim

## Overview

**monava.nvim** is a modern Neovim plugin that provides intelligent navigation and management for monorepo projects. It bridges the gap between complex monorepo structures and efficient developer workflows by offering seamless integration with popular picker backends and smart detection of various monorepo types.

## Problem Statement

Developers working with monorepos face several navigation challenges:

- **Context Switching Overhead**: Manually navigating between packages/workspaces
- **Fragmented Tooling**: Different pickers and tools for different monorepo types
- **Discovery Complexity**: Finding relevant files, packages, and dependencies
- **Performance Issues**: Slow searches in large repositories

## Product Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Unified Navigation Experience**: Single interface for all monorepo types and picker backends
2. **Intelligent Detection**: Automatic recognition of monorepo structure and type
3. **Performance Optimization**: Fast searches and navigation with smart caching
4. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce context switching and discovery time

### Secondary Goals

1. **Extensibility**: Support for new monorepo types and picker backends
2. **Configuration Flexibility**: Customizable workflows and preferences
3. **Stability**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- **Frontend Developers**: Working with JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos (Nx, Lerna, Yarn/NPM workspaces)
- **Rust Developers**: Managing Cargo workspace projects
- **Full-Stack Developers**: Working across multiple technology stacks in monorepos

### Secondary Users

- **Python Developers**: Poetry monorepo projects (planned)
- **Go Developers**: Multi-module repositories (planned)
- **Java Developers**: Gradle/Maven multi-module projects (planned)

## Key Features
