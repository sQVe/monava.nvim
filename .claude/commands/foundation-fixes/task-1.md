- **Leverage existing code** whenever possible to avoid rebuilding functionality
- Mark task as complete by changing [ ] to [x] in tasks.md
- Stop after completion and wait for user approval
- Do not automatically proceed to the next task

## Next Steps
After task completion, you can:
- Review the implementation
- Run tests if applicable
